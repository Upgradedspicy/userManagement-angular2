User Management - Angular 2 Typescript

1.Open a command prompt
2.Type: npm install This installs the node-module and typings dependencies
3.Type: npm start This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and watches for changes. It also starts the lite-server and launches in the browser to run the application on port 3000.

This is the simple application to kickstart with Angular 2 Projects (Typescript)

Here, I have covered the following features which are used in the application

-> Routing (SPA - Single Page Application)
-> Module
-> Component
-> Service (HTTP Module with Observables)
-> Pipe (For filtering)
-> Inferface (For Custome Type based on the Data's)
-> Subscribe (For HTTP Module - Observables)
-> Modal (@ng-bootstrap) with Boostrap 4
-> Other angular methods like [(ngModel)], *ngFor, *ngIf & (click)
